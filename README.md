## Introduction:
Our project deals with the application of Machine Learning in industrial environemnt in the field of Mechanical Engineering. Given vibrational data collected using 4 vibration sensors placed in four different corners of a gearbox, our model will analyse the data and predict if the gearbox has a broken tooth and hence, if the gearbox is healthy or not. 

## Data Collection:
Dataset used: [Gearbox Fault Analysis - Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/brjapon/gearbox-fault-diagnosis) \
Gearbox Fault Diagnosis Data set include the vibration dataset recorded by using SpectraQuestâ€™s Gearbox Fault Diagnostics Simulator.
Dataset has been recorded using 4 vibration sensors placed in four different direction, and under variation of load from '0' to '90' percent. Two different scenario are included: \
[1] Healthy condition and \
[2] Broken Tooth Condition
